# Structured-Data-Extraction-from-Segmented-Historical-Records-using-Gemini-Vision-OCR
Developed an end-to-end pipeline to extract structured text and coordinates from segmented historical documents using Gemini API and Google Vision OCR. Incorporates intelligent image classification, key rotation, and coordinate-based record localization with post-processed output in pipe-delimited format.
